### General information

Information provided by Microsoft Teams Ecosystem to Microsoft:

| **Information** | **Response** |
|:----------------|:-------------|
| App name | Aha! |
| ID | 83071ebb-65ae-4049-ab0b-63407cf38303 |
| Capabilities | Connector |
| Partner company name | Microsoft Teams Ecosystem |
| URL of partner website | <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId&#x3D;730642> |
| URL of Teams application info page | <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId&#x3D;730642> |

| URL of Terms of Use | <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId&#x3D;730642> |
| Service notes | This app contains a connector written by Microsoft, so effectively it&#x27;s a hybrid between code written by Microsoft and the Aha! app. When the connector is created, it&#x27;s Microsoft&#x27;s code that&#x27;s running. When an event occurs in the Aha! app, it&#x27;s code in that app that generates the message which appears in a Microsoft Teams channel. |
