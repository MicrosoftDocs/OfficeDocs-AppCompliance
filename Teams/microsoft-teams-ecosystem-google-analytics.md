### General information

Information provided by Microsoft Teams Ecosystem to Microsoft:

| **Information** | **Response** |
|:----------------|:-------------|
| App name | Google Analytics |
| ID | 4fcf98ff-e696-44e3-b4df-a6aff076ee1b |
| Capabilities | Connector |
| Partner company name | Microsoft Teams Ecosystem |
| URL of partner website | <https://www.google.com/analytics> |
| URL of Teams application info page | <https://www.google.com/analytics> |
| URL of Privacy Policy | <https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl&#x3D;en> |
| URL of Terms of Use | <https://www.google.com/analytics> |
| Service notes | This app contains a connector written by Microsoft, so effectively it&#x27;s a hybrid between code written by Microsoft and the Google Analytics app. When the connector is created, it&#x27;s Microsoft&#x27;s code that&#x27;s running. When an event occurs in the Google Analytics app, it&#x27;s code in that app that generates the message which appears in a Microsoft Teams channel. |
