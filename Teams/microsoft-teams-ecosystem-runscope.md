| Service notes | This app contains a connector written by Microsoft, so effectively it&#x27;s a hybrid between code written by Microsoft and the Runscope app. When the connector is created, it&#x27;s Microsoft&#x27;s code that&#x27;s running. When an event occurs in the Runscope app, it&#x27;s code in that app that generates the message which appears in a Microsoft Teams channel. |
