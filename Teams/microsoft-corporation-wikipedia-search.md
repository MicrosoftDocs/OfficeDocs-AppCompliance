### General information

Information provided by Microsoft Corporation to Microsoft:

| **Information** | **Response** |
|:----------------|:-------------|
| App name | Wikipedia Search |
| ID | 25492237-70ef-4c56-a36e-dd3405edd40e |
| Capabilities | Bot, Messaging Extension |
| Partner company name | Microsoft Corporation |
| URL of partner website | <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/> |
| URL of Teams application info page | <https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum?> |

| Service notes | This app contains a connector written by Microsoft, so effectively it&#x27;s a hybrid between code written by Microsoft and the Wikipedia Search app. When the connector is created, it&#x27;s Microsoft&#x27;s code that&#x27;s running. When an event occurs in the Wikipedia Search app, it&#x27;s code in that app that generates the message which appears in a Microsoft Teams channel. |
