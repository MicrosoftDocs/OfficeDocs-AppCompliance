### How the app handles data

Information provided by MURAL on how this app collects and stores organizational data, and what control an organization has over this data.

#### Data access using Microsoft Graph

List any Microsoft Graph permissions this app requires, and for each, whether they are delegate or application permissions, the justification and purpose for this permission (what does the app use this information for?), and whether the app stores any of this information in its databases.

>| **Permission**  | **Delegated/Application** | **Justification/Purpose** | **Is any of this data stored in app database(s)?** |
>|:----------------|:--------------------------|:--------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|
>| N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

#### Data access via bots

If this app contains a bot or a messaging extension, it can access the roster (first name, last name, display name, email address) of any team member in a team or chat it's added to. Do this app make use of this capability?

>We are only getting and storing the user&#x27;s name.

>| **Access team/chat roster?**  | **Justification/Purpose** | **Is any of this data stored in app database(s)?** |
>|:--------------------------------|:---------------------|:--------------------------|
>|  |  |  |

#### Telemetry data

Does any organizational information, including EUII (end-user identifiable information) and OII (organizational identifiable information), appears in this application's telemetry/logs? If yes, describe what data is present and what controls/processes an organization has in place to archive and/or delete it. If no, describe the controls/processes in place to prevent EUII and OII from appearing in telemetry/logs.

>Yes, we log personal information (username, email, etc.) to build our audit log. The information is stored in our database encrypted and can only be accessed when consulting the audit api.

#### Storing and securing organizational data

Describe where/how is this application's data is stored and how access to it is controlled. Is it encrypted? Who can access it? How do you ensure that only authorized systems/individuals can access it? Examples: 2FA for all admins, Privileged Access Management (PMA), partitioning service admin accounts from Azure AD/corporate user accounts, protected IP ranges between systems, etc.

>Data is stored in our Microsoft Azure Cloud service. The data is stored encrypted at rest with AES-256. Our infrastructure and devops team has access to the database management, but not to the data itself. Users login to the system with MFA and there's an audit trail of every action taken by them once in the infra.

#### Organizational controls for data stored by partner

Describe any capabilities an organization's administrators have to control their information residing in partner systems, e.g. deletion, retention, auditing, archiving, end-user policy, etc.

>Administrators can manage users, delete them, delete murals, etc. The user policy is here: https://mural.co/terms
