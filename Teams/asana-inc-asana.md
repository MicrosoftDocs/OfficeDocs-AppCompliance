### How the app handles data

Information provided by Asana, Inc. on how this app collects and stores organizational data, and what control an organization has over this data.

#### Data access using Microsoft Graph

This application does not use Microsoft Graph.


#### Telemetry data

Does any organizational information, including EUII (end-user identifiable information) and OII (organizational identifiable information), appears in this application's telemetry/logs? If yes, describe what data is present and what controls/processes an organization has in place to archive and/or delete it. If no, describe the controls/processes in place to prevent EUII and OII from appearing in telemetry/logs.

>Not specified.

#### Storing and securing organizational data

Describe where/how is this application's data is stored and how access to it is controlled. Is it encrypted? Who can access it? How do you ensure that only authorized systems/individuals can access it? Examples: 2FA for all admins, Privileged Access Management (PMA), partitioning service admin accounts from Azure AD/corporate user accounts, protected IP ranges between systems, etc.

>Enterprise customers have guaranteed encryption at rest using AES-256. Data is stored on Amazon Web Services and AWS manages the encryption keys using their Key Management system. We do have 2FA for all admins. Access is given on the principle of least privilege.

#### Organizational controls for data stored by partner

Describe any capabilities an organization's administrators have to control their information residing in partner systems, e.g. deletion, retention, auditing, archiving, end-user policy, etc.

>Your Asana Organizational admins have the ability to setup SAML, SCIM, Service accounts and have an overarching view of the data that is put into the tool. Admins can request a full organizational export from within the Admin console and audit as needed.
