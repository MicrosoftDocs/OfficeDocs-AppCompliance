#### Data access using Microsoft Graph

List any [Microsoft Graph permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference) this app requires, and for each, whether they are delegate or application permissions, the justification and purpose for this permission (what does the app use this information for?), and whether the app stores any of this information in its databases.

>| **Permission**  | **Delegated/Application** | **Justification/Purpose** | **Is any of this data stored in app database(s)?** |
>|:----------------|:--------------------------|:--------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|

>| offline_access | Delegated | Maintain access to data you have given it access to |  |
>| profile | Delegated | View user&#x27;s basic profile |  |


#### Telemetry data

Does any organizational information, including EUII (end-user identifiable information) and OII (organizational identifiable information), appears in this application's telemetry/logs? If yes, describe what data is present and what controls/processes an organization has in place to archive and/or delete it. If no, describe the controls/processes in place to prevent EUII and OII from appearing in telemetry/logs.

>We don&#x27;t collect EUII / PII in telementry / logs.  We have scripts in place which look for patterns and alert for fixing it

#### Storing and securing organizational data

Describe where/how is this application's data is stored and how access to it is controlled. Is it encrypted? Who can access it? How do you ensure that only authorized systems/individuals can access it? Examples: 2FA for all admins, Privileged Access Management (PMA), partitioning service admin accounts from Azure AD/corporate user accounts, protected IP ranges between systems, etc.

>All the customer data is encrypted at rest. Logical access to the servers is provided through an isolated &amp; dedicated network and is highly secured and monitored. This network is protected with Firewall, 2- Factor Authentication and Kerberos Authentication Protocol. The accessing machines are securely hardened so that no data can be copied or transferred from the data center. Physical Access to the data centers are protected with Biometric+PIN. No visitors are allowed inside the dedicated cages of Zoho in the data centers. Only a very restricted number of employees have the access to the servers to carry out any emergency works.

#### Organizational controls for data stored by partner

Describe any capabilities an organization's administrators have to control their information residing in partner systems, e.g. deletion, retention, auditing, archiving, end-user policy, etc.

>Customers - as a data controller have complete access to their data all the time.
