### General information

Information provided by Microsoft Teams Ecosystem to Microsoft:

| **Information** | **Response** |
|:----------------|:-------------|
| App name | GitHub Enterprise |
| ID | ca319335-400e-43c1-bca4-b6c745ce3093 |
| Capabilities | Connector |
| Partner company name | Microsoft Teams Ecosystem |
| URL of partner website | <https://enterprise.github.com/home> |
| URL of Teams application info page | <https://enterprise.github.com/home> |
| URL of Privacy Policy | <https://enterprise.github.com/privacy> |
| URL of Terms of Use | <https://enterprise.github.com/home> |
| Service notes | This app contains a connector written by Microsoft, so effectively it&#x27;s a hybrid between code written by Microsoft and the GitHub Enterprise app. When the connector is created, it&#x27;s Microsoft&#x27;s code that&#x27;s running. When an event occurs in the GitHub Enterprise app, it&#x27;s code in that app that generates the message which appears in a Microsoft Teams channel. |
