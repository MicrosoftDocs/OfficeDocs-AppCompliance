### How the app handles data

Information provided by Evernote on how this app collects and stores organizational data, and what control an organization has over this data.

#### Data access using Microsoft Graph

This application does not use Microsoft Graph.


#### Telemetry data

Does any organizational information, including EUII (end-user identifiable information) and OII (organizational identifiable information), appears in this application's telemetry/logs? If yes, describe what data is present and what controls/processes an organization has in place to archive and/or delete it. If no, describe the controls/processes in place to prevent EUII and OII from appearing in telemetry/logs.

>Not specified.

#### Storing and securing organizational data

Describe where/how is this application's data is stored and how access to it is controlled. Is it encrypted? Who can access it? How do you ensure that only authorized systems/individuals can access it? Examples: 2FA for all admins, Privileged Access Management (PMA), partitioning service admin accounts from Azure AD/corporate user accounts, protected IP ranges between systems, etc.

>Customer data that we store in GCP will be protected using Googleï¿½s built-in encryption-at-rest features. 
User generated content access is 
- restricted based on business need 
- requires customer approval, and internal manager approval prior to accessing user generated content 
Access is granted following least privilege principles: role based access control in the service admin tool and access to systems within production environment is based on business needs. Both 2FA and IP whitelisting are used for customer service team members.

#### Organizational controls for data stored by partner

Describe any capabilities an organization's administrators have to control their information residing in partner systems, e.g. deletion, retention, auditing, archiving, end-user policy, etc.

>The admin console is where account admins can manage Evernote Business account information, users, and content. Some of things account admins can do in admin console:
- View account summary
- Add and manage users
- View and manage spaces, notebooks, notes, tags, and trash
- View and manage account billing, security, and integrations
