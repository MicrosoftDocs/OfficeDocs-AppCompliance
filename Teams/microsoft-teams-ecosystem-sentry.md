### General information

Information provided by Microsoft Teams Ecosystem to Microsoft:

| **Information** | **Response** |
|:----------------|:-------------|
| App name | Sentry |
| ID | 7f87ec3d-e837-4371-976d-cb824302849c |
| Capabilities | Connector |
| Partner company name | Microsoft Teams Ecosystem |
| URL of partner website | <https://sentry.io/welcome/> |
| URL of Teams application info page | <https://sentry.io/welcome/> |
| URL of Privacy Policy | <https://sentry.io/privacy/> |
| URL of Terms of Use | <https://sentry.io/terms/> |
| Service notes | This app contains a connector written by Microsoft, so effectively it&#x27;s a hybrid between code written by Microsoft and the Sentry app. When the connector is created, it&#x27;s Microsoft&#x27;s code that&#x27;s running. When an event occurs in the Sentry app, it&#x27;s code in that app that generates the message which appears in a Microsoft Teams channel. |
