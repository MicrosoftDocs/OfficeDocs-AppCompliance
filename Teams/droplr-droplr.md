#### Telemetry data

Does any organizational information, including EUII (end-user identifiable information) and OII (organizational identifiable information), appears in this application's telemetry/logs? If yes, describe what data is present and what controls/processes an organization has in place to archive and/or delete it. If no, describe the controls/processes in place to prevent EUII and OII from appearing in telemetry/logs.

>No. It is against our policy to log user data.

#### Storing and securing organizational data

Describe where/how is this application's data is stored and how access to it is controlled. Is it encrypted? Who can access it? How do you ensure that only authorized systems/individuals can access it? Examples: 2FA for all admins, Privileged Access Management (PMA), partitioning service admin accounts from Azure AD/corporate user accounts, protected IP ranges between systems, etc.

>Our application data is stored within our own virtual private cloud with network access control lists that prevent unauthorized requests going to our internal network. User data can only be accessed via 2FA. Direct access to database servers is protected behind 2FA and a jump box. All backups are encrypted at rest and deleted after 30 days.

#### Organizational controls for data stored by partner

Describe any capabilities an organization's administrators have to control their information residing in partner systems, e.g. deletion, retention, auditing, archiving, end-user policy, etc.

>Users can delete their data at any time by logging into their Droplr account. Team administrators can additionally delete and archive data at any time (requires an Enterprise subscription).
