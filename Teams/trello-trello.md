### CSA STAR information

[Cloud Security Alliance](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/about/) is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to defining and raising awareness of best practices to help ensure a secure cloud computing environment. The CSA maintains the [Security, Trust & Assurance Registry (STAR)](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star/), a free, publicly-accessible registry where cloud-based providers can publish information on security, privacy, and compliance practices. The STAR registry contains three levels of assurance: self-assessment, 3rd-party audit, and continuous monitoring. More information on assurance levels can be found [here](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star/#_overview).
