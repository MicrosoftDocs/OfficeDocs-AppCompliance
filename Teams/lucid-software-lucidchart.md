### How the app handles data

Information provided by Lucid Software on how this app collects and stores organizational data, and what control an organization has over this data.

#### Data access using Microsoft Graph

This application does not use Microsoft Graph.


#### Telemetry data

Does any organizational information, including EUII (end-user identifiable information) and OII (organizational identifiable information), appears in this application's telemetry/logs? If yes, describe what data is present and what controls/processes an organization has in place to archive and/or delete it. If no, describe the controls/processes in place to prevent EUII and OII from appearing in telemetry/logs.

>We log email and IP addresses for security and support reasons. All access to logs is recorded &amp; logs are actually unchangeable in a third party system. Access to logs requires MFA.

#### Storing and securing organizational data

Describe where/how is this application's data is stored and how access to it is controlled. Is it encrypted? Who can access it? How do you ensure that only authorized systems/individuals can access it? Examples: 2FA for all admins, Privileged Access Management (PMA), partitioning service admin accounts from Azure AD/corporate user accounts, protected IP ranges between systems, etc.

>Lucidchart data is stored in AWS. It is encrypted at rest and in transit. Lucidchart uses the rules of least privilege and MFA. More information can be provided after an MNDA has been signed.

#### Organizational controls for data stored by partner

Describe any capabilities an organization's administrators have to control their information residing in partner systems, e.g. deletion, retention, auditing, archiving, end-user policy, etc.

>Lucidchart&#x27;s Admin controls are described here: https://lucidchart.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004081086-Admin-Panel
